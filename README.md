# BigRedConfessionWall

Built with Django, this web app allows users within a certain community to post contents (confessions, suggestions, etc.) anonymously and view and comment on others' posts. 

It has the following three key features:

1. Information safety. Information about post authors is hashed and hidden from viewers and even the administrators. 
2. Automatic toxicity detection. Toxic and other suspicious contents will be labeled and hidden from users automatically by our NLP model until an admin looks at it and marks it otherwise.
3. Beautiful design. Inspired by [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/), our webpage will be really enjoyable to view and fun to interact with.
